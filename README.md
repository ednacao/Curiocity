# Curiocity
Curiocity is an exploration app that helps you discover secret spaces in San Francisco. The app uses the HTML5 Geolocation API to find your current coordinates to connect you to obscure and hidden areas that are easily overlooked. Inspired by the recent resurgence of interest in [privately-owned public open spaces](http://www.sf-planning.org/index.aspx?page=3339) in San Francisco, Curiocity navigates you through hidden city treasures, from a rooftop garden to a cliffside labyrinth.
